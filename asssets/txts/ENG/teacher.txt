MARI LAURENIUS

My passion is to help those who believe they cannot learn math - everyone can! I have helped children under school age to achieve a level where they can start school as skilled mathematicians, and young adults to overcome math learning difficulties that have followed them throughout all their school years, and everything in between.

From experience, I know that the earlier attention is paid to these issues, the more likely difficulties can be avoided. Read more to find out who I am.

Don't let math be a monster that limits your future. Contact me bravely, let's discuss more!

My education:
- M.Ed., Special Education
